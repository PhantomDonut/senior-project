# Lux's Journey

## Overview
Created as my Senior Project to conclude my time at the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, <i>Lux's Journey</i> is a culmination of all the time and hard work put into honing my craft over these past seven years. The project fits neatly into the genre of three-dimensional platformer, with a touch of adventure infused into it. Playing as Lux, a whimsical yet friendly looking creature, the player explores the magic of several distinct levels to acquire celestial shards. Faced with challenging platforming, time-based puzzles, and hidden objects, the game strikes a balance between lighthearted and adventurous.

## Process
Created over the course of five months, designing an entire game is a markedly ambitious project objective, but it was made much easier by dividing the process into more achievable sections. During my pre-production phase, I established a clearly defined scope for the game and began brainstorming various features which would help the game to be visually and mechanically exciting.. Starting with the player character, I challenged myself to develop polished visuals and gameplay mechanics for
each (modular) piece of the game, as a way of making the creation of levels easier. This decision made the proces feel less daunting, as big tasks like the user interface, time manager, collectible system, and camera controller all could become my sole focus for a few days in order to perfect
them. Fluctuating between narrow and broad scopes also provided a sense of perspective when deciding which features deserved the largest time investment, as the goal truly was to ensure the game would be as enjoyable as possible â€” my guiding design principle.
